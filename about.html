    <p>
            In at risk communities, sanitary pads, if available, are very low down on the list of necessities. These disadvantaged are forced to use, paper, leaves, rags or anything else they can get their hands on, often leading to infection.

            In many instances young girls commencing their period have no idea what is happening, have no one to turn to and because of myths and shame surrounding this most natural of bodily functions are too afraid to ask for assistance.
            
            At you go girl we have these goals:
            
          <p> Enabling Girls in school. by providing her with washable, multi use pads we give her an opportunity to participate fully in school.

          </p>

          <p> 
          Empowering SMEs. Our products are manufactured by sewers who are building their own business. We skill, teach and provide a safe place to manufacture.
        </p>

        <p>
          MHM Education. We teach about menstrual health to young girls, boys, parents, community leaders, influencers and teachers.
           
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Sustainability. Our pads last approximately 48 months. For each Dignity Dreams washable pad we replace 144 disposable pads. Our pads are ecologically friendly and should be worn by every woman who care about our planet. We also comply with 10 out of 17 of the Global Sustainable Goals.
       
        </p>
